Colorz.io

Many app developers lack the artistic savvy to create an aesthetically pleasing UI for their app clients. Our goal is to simplify the process of UI creation by helping developers pick the color scheme for their projects. Informed by some of the leading research in color theory, we aggregate and serve color schemes that suit developers needs.
